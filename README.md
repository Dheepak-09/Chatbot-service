# Chatbot-service
This Python script defines a **Flask-based Interview Chatbot** that assists with interview scheduling, answering user queries, and summarizing PDFs. It integrates **LangChain** and **Groq's Llama3 model** to generate responses. Users can ask questions or upload PDFs, and the bot extracts and summarizes text efficiently.
