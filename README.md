# Chatbot-service
The code implements a Flask-based chatbot using LangChain and Groq's LLM. It provides two main functionalities: answering user questions and summarizing uploaded PDF files. The chatbot initializes an LLM chain, handles API requests via Flask routes, extracts text from PDFs using PyMuPDF, and generates concise summaries. It securely manages API keys, validates inputs, and runs on port 5000. The chatbot ensures structured, professional responses while handling errors gracefully.
